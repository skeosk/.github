# Mahiti Bandhu
[Mahiti Bandhu](https://mahitibandhu.com/) is an innovative solar-powered information system designed to provide valuable information to rural communities. The kiosk is designed to offer comprehensive information on various government schemes and initiatives aimed at improving the livelihoods of people in rural areas. This project has been made possible through funding from [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/), an organization dedicated to promoting technology advancements for the benefit of humanity.

The kiosk provides valuable information on a range of topics, including education, agriculture, healthcare, and employment. By offering comprehensive details on government schemes and initiatives, Mahiti Bandhu helps rural communities access the resources and support they need to improve their lives.

The system is powered by solar energy, making it a sustainable and eco-friendly solution. This is particularly important in rural areas where access to reliable power is often limited. The kiosk is user-friendly, and information is displayed in a clear and accessible manner, making it easy for people with limited literacy skills to understand.
